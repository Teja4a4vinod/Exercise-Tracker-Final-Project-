Final:

I tried to modify the code from ng Bootstrap to send request to the server to get the friends names when we search. I was facing issues at my client side , I was not able to understand how to search for the friends. 

I understand the concept of getting and posting the things between client and server, but I was confused with searching and messed up the code.
